## Limited-MAX: A Flexible Master Bus Limiter
  
Limited-MAX is one of the plugins included in the LVC-Audio plugin bundle. It is a specialized limiter that is suitable for final mixing or mastering. It dynamically combines several unique limiting algorithms to provide a transparent limiting for all audio sources. It is capable of significant levels of compression/limiting without inadvertently creating an excessive amount of audible distortion.
  
Limited-MAX is highly customizable and suitable for a wide range of music sources. It allows you to fine-tune and find the best sound from a huge number of options, rather than from a few preset algorithms. You can adjust the standard attack and release controls, the customizable look-ahead controls, the stereo linking, and the variable control style that changes the sound and shape of the limiter compression curve.
  
In addition, Limited-MAX includes a selectable DC filter and complete dithering controls, with a choice of dithering and psychoacoustic filtering. It also has a choice of 2x, 4x or 8x linear oversampling for maximum accuracy.
  
Limited-MAX also features a visual output meter and a waveform history display that can be switched between the normal view and the K-Metering standards (K-20, K-14 and K-12). The selectable secondary meter can be modified to display the standard gain reduction of the limiter, input metering, inter-sample peaks (ISP), or estimated distortion levels.
  
Limited-MAX has been praised by many users and reviewers as one of the best limiters out there. It has received a 4.5 out of 5 star review from musicradar.com and has been featured as one of the top freeware utilities by Computer Music magazine.
  
## Toned-MAX: A Versatile Digital Equalizer with Analog Modeling
  
Toned-MAX is another plugin included in the LVC-Audio plugin bundle. It is a versatile digital equalizer with analog modeling that can be creatively used on individual tracks or on the master bus. It can help you shape your sound with precision and warmth.
  
Toned-MAX includes 15 different filter types, including standard high-pass, low-pass, shelf, and peak filters. It also includes a tilt filter, a constant Q bell filter, a band-pass filter, and filter types that simulate analog shelf filters. The filters include additional parameters such as a Q-Link control to further simulate analog filter types, and two different dynamic equalizer parameters for simple and easy dynamic equalization.
  
All filters can work in stereo, left, right, mid or side modes. You can also adjust the input gain, output gain, dry/wet mix, phase inversion, bypass switch, and oversampling settings for each filter.
  
Besides the various types of analog filters that can be achieved by combining different filters and the Q-Link function, Toned-MAX also includes the analog simulation of LVC-Audio as found in PreAMPed and T-Chain (preamp models and vintage compressors). You can choose from 10 different analog models that add subtle harmonic distortion and coloration to your sound.
  
Toned-MAX also features a visual spectrum analyzer that shows the input
