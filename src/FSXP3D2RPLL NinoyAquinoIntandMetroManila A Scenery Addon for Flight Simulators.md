The Ninoy Aquino International Airport is the main international gateway to the Philippines and serves as a hub for several airlines. It is located about 7 km south of Manila, the capital city of the country. The airport has four terminals and two runways, one of which is a crosswind runway that is rarely used.
 
The Metro Manila area is the most populous and urbanized region in the Philippines, with an estimated population of over 13 million people. It consists of 16 cities and one municipality, covering an area of about 619 km2. The region is known for its cultural diversity, historical landmarks, modern skyscrapers, shopping malls, and traffic congestion.
 
This scenery add-on features two versions of the airport, one with the crosswind runway active and one without. It also includes assigned parking, support vehicle roads, extra fuel truck, a helipad, and other improvements. The add-on also enhances the Metro Manila area with more accurate buildings, landmarks, roads, bridges, and vegetation.
